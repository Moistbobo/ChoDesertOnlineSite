<h2>Hotfixes</h2>
<p>A quick hotfix and update has been applied to the game.</p>
<p>Strength now has a hardcap of 18. This is to prevent people from getting too strong too quickly while the levelling system is being revamped.</p>
<p>Various string fixes and QOL fixes such as RPG commands working in non-rpg channels has also been applied.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>There are plans to revamp the levelling system so that it uses a EXP - Level with assignable skill points. There will also be expansions to the dungeon system, such as a floor system and additional monsters. Consumables are also in the works.</p>

<h2>Inventory and Equipment System</h2>
<p>To accommodate the new dungeon system, an inventory and equipment system has been added. Items can be obtained either randomly
in channels that have item drops enabled or from defeating monsters in dungeon mode. The inventory and equipped weapon can be checked using the <mark>.inventory</mark> command.

</br>
Additionally, weapons can be equipped by using the <mark>.equip [weaponIndex]</mark> and <mark>.unequipweapon</mark> commands.</br></br>
While weapons can be obtained as drops, stronger weapons will require crafting. To check the available craftin recipes and the required mats, use the <mark>.craftrecipes</mark> or <mark>.cr</mark> command. To craft an item, use the <mark>.craft [recipeIndex]</mark> command;

</p>
<h2>QOL Changes</h2>
<p>Apart from some incorrect string fixes, the ability to heal other players has been added. However, to prevent abuse, heals on other players
are less effective than regular heals.</p>
