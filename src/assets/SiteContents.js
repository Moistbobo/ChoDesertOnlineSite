<h2>Inventory and Equipment System</h2>
<p>To accommodate the new dungeon system, an inventory and equipment system has been added. Items can be obtained either randomly
in channels that have item drops enabled or from defeating monsters in dungeon mode. The inventory and equipped weapon can be checked using the <mark>.inventory</mark> command.

</br>
Additionally, weapons can be equipped by using the <mark>.equip [weaponIndex]</mark> and <mark>.unequipweapon</mark> commands.</br></br>
While weapons can be obtained as drops, stronger weapons will require crafting. To check the available craftin recipes and the required mats, use the <mark>.craftrecipes</mark> command. To craft an item, use the <mark>.craft [recipeIndex]</mark> command;

<h2>QOL Changes</h2>
<p>Apart from some incorrect string fixes, the ability to heal other players has been added. However, to prevent abuse, heals on other players
are less effective than regular heals.</p>
